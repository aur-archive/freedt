.SH NAME
\fBrecordio \fP- recordio records the input and output of a program.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
\fBrecordio\fP \fIprog\fP
.fam T
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBrecordio\fP runs \fIprog\fP. It prints lines to descriptor 2 showing the input and output of \fIprog\fP.
.PP
At the beginning of each line on descriptor 2, \fBrecordio\fP inserts the \fIprog\fP process ID, along with < for input or > for output. At the end of each line it inserts +, a space, or [EOF]; a space indicates that there was a new line in the input or output, and [EOF] indicates the end of input or output.
.PP
\fBrecordio\fP prints every packet of input and output immediately. It does not attempt to combine packets into coherent lines. For example,
.PP
.nf
.fam C
                recordio sh -c 'cat /dev/fd/8 2>&1' > /dev/null

.fam T
.fi
could produce
.PP
.nf
.fam C
                5135 > cat: /dev/fd/8: Bad file descriptor 
                5135 > [EOF]

.fam T
.fi
or
.PP
.nf
.fam C
                5135 > cat: +
                5135 > /dev/fd/8+
                5135 > : +
                5135 > Bad file descriptor 
                5135 > [EOF]

.fam T
.fi
if the cat program prints several packets.
.PP
\fBrecordio\fP uses several lines for long packets to guarantee that each line is printed atomically. 
\fBrecordio\fP runs as a child process of \fIprog\fP. It exits when it sees the end of \fIprog\fP's output.
